# Password-Generator
This program is a password generator.

The user presses a 'Generate Password' button and is first asked how long they wish thier password to be.
The password must be greater than or equal to 8 and less than or equal to 128 charachters in length.  The length of 
the password if verified. If an incorrect length is not entered after 4 tries a message will be displayed telling
the user that the incorrect length has been entered and they can not get a password unless they press the 
Generate Password button again.

After a correct lenght is entered, the user is asked to confirm whether they want Speical Characters, Numbers,
Lower Case, and Upper Case letters. Once all questions are answered, the password is generated. If no option is
entered for Special Characters, Numbers, Lower Case, or Upper Case letters, an alert will pop-up notifying the
user and they will have to start all over again.
